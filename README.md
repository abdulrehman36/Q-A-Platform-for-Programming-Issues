# Q&A Platform for Programming Issues
A Q&A platform where programmers can post questions, reply with solutions, and discuss coding topics.
Users can create accounts, manage their posts, and participate in discussions with nested replies.
The platform includes a rating system for upvoting or downvoting replies, a search feature to filter posts by keyword or user, and admin moderation tools for managing users and content.

## How to Run the Application
- **Create a `.env` File** – In the root of the project folder, add the following configuration:

  ```bash
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your_mysql_root_password>
  MYSQL_DATABASE=<your_database_name>

  DB_HOST=mysql
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASSWORD=<your_mysql_root_password>
  DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
  DB_PORT=3306
  ```
- **Build the Containers** – Make sure Docker is installed and running, then in the project directory run:
 ```docker
docker compose build
 ```
- **Start the Containers** – After the build completes, run the following command to start the services:
 ```docker
docker compose up
 ```
- **Access the Application** – Once the containers are running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5173/
- The frontend will launch automatically and connect to the backend and database.
